As with Conway's Game of Life, this is just another CodeWars Kata I'm happy with: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5765870e190b1472ec0022a2 

The path finder follows the hand on the wall rule to solve a maze mentioned here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm#Hand_On_Wall_Rule

It passess all CodeWars tests, which include several initial tests followed by a large array of randomly generated tests. 

**TODO:**
- Create my own test suite. I haven't yet as I am exploring how to randomly generate tests.
- Refactor when I have the time, perhaps implementing A* to solves these test suites as well.
